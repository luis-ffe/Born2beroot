This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

• The use of VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox) is mandatory. \
• You only have to turn in a signature.txt file at the root of your repository. \
• There are already too many guides and places to help you in this project so i will keep this page simple. Go to [Pasqual Rossi GITHUB](https://github.com/pasqualerossi) or [Jotavare](https://github.com/jotavare) they have sections with resources to help you finding information on the topic.
